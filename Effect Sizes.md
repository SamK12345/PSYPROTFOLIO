# Effect Sizes

Quntifies the amount or degree of seperation between two distrubtions.

Simliar to [[Correlations]] is assoicated with a scale
- d = 0.2 = small effect
- d = 0.5 = medium effect
- d= 0.8 = large effect

**One sample d-test**
>$$ d = \frac{mean diff}{stdev} = \frac{mu_1 - mu_2}{\sigma} $$

**Two independent samples**
>$$ d = \frac{mean.diff}{pooled.stdev} = \frac{\overline{X-X_2}}{s_p}$$

**Two paired samples**
>$$ d = \frac{mean.diff}{stdev.diff} = \frac{\underline{x} - \underline{y}}{s_p}$$
