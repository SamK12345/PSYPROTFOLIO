# Factorial ANOVA
Alllows us to find the varience of between groups that are subjected to two or more *indepdent variables*;. Unilike normal [[ANOVA]]. 

## Main effects
Anaylzes the effect of an idividual factor on a dependent variable. Usually aveages the results with the addition of a additonal IV.
### Interactions
The main effects of the IV's are combined and differentatied into a central  interaction, *Differences in rows/columns in a ANOVA table*.

## Pros and Cons
*Pros*
	-	Allows for the calculation of sigfigence with more than one indepdent variable.
	-	Allows for a 'method of rates' like testing of varience.
	
*Cons*
	-	Is a parametric test , requires a assumed normal curve.

## Use when,
You are testing more than two indepdent variables ***AT A SINGLE TIME  IN A GROUP***

Notes; Factorial ANOVAS also apply to repeated/releated samples.

### Factorai ANOVA Sums of Squares
$$SS_{total} = SS_{Cells} + SS_{error}$$

$$SS_a + SS_B + SS_{AB}$$

### Sources of Vairence

## Preregitration 
Ex reserach question; Is there a stastical difference within the following setup: A and B and AB?
A typical H(a) and H(0) for each condition **and a setup for the interactions between the two variables.**
